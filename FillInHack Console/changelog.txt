04.09.22 Added FIH Updater and linked Console to the updater
===========
05.09.22
	* Updater:
	- After the running of the Updater, the Console will appear in a new window.
	- If any exception/error is thrown, the versions file will be deleted in order to let the Console when opened to run the Updater firstly.
	BUGS RESOLVED:
	- If the user was closing the program, it wouldn't delete the versions file. This was resolved by adding the same function as in FIH_Console: SetConsoleCtrlHandler that checks for the CTRL-Break event or when the user presses the x button from the panel.
	- When the Console ran from the updater program, it's path was set to Updater's path. This was resolved by setting Console's working directory manual from code.
